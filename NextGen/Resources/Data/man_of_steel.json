Cavill was 18 and had already developed the square jaw and piercing stare that would soon make him a successful leading man, going up for roles like Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins and even James Bond in Casino Royale. He lost those roles to more well-known actors, but had no trouble building up his résumé with supporting roles in movies like Tristan & Isolde, before scoring the prominent role of Charles Brandon on the Showtime series The Tudors in 2007. He enjoyed a small part in the Woody Allen movie Whatever Works, and had a larger role in the action film Immortals in 2011. He was tapped to take over the iconic role of Superman in the planned 2013 project Man of Steel.",

After high school, she studied dance and worked in regional dinner theater until age 20, when she moved to Minnesota with her family after being spotted by a visiting Minneapolis producer and recruited to work in his dinner theater there. She landed her first film role in the satiric 1999 comedy Drop Dead Gorgeous, which was, appropriately enough, set in Minnesota. After appearing in the independent comedy Psycho Beach Party, Adams made guest appearances on a number of television series, including That 70s Show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and The West Wing; she was also cast as a regular in Manchester Prep, a TV spin-off of the hit film Cruel Intentions. Manchester Prep, however, was never aired when its network decided that the show's sexual content was too strong for television, although several episodes were eventually re-edited into a direct-to-video feature entitled Cruel Intentions 2. 2002 proved to be a very busy year for Adams, who appeared in no fewer than four features, including the eagerly anticipated Catch Me if You Can, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.",

Whenever necessary, Shannon imperceptibly blended into the material at hand. He played a therapist in Nicole Kassell's psychodrama The Woodsman (2004), yet by virtue of his emotional intensity and eccentric look, Shannon evinced an ability to dominate with his onscreen presence, as well.",

It wasn't long before the late-'70s found Lane reaching the apex of her early career, and in 1978 she made her film debut in director George Roy Hill's A Little Romance. Cast alongside no less than Sir Laurence Olivier, Lane held her own in the role of an American student who finds love while studying abroad, and as a result gained remarkable exposure on the cover of Time Magazine in August of the following year.",

        "biography": "Though perhaps best-known internationally for playing tough-guy roles in Romper Stomper (1993), L.A. Confidential (1997), and Gladiator (2000), New Zealand-born actor Russell Crowe has proven himself equally capable of playing gentler roles in films such as Proof (1991) and The Sum of Us (1992). No matter what kind of characters he plays, Crowe's weather-beaten handsomeness and gruff charisma combine to make him constantly watchable: his one-time Hollywood mentor Sharon Stone has called him 'the sexiest guy working in movies today.'",

Zurer subsequently chalked up a covetable series of Hollywood roles, typically playing characters of variable Middle Eastern origin; projects included Paul Schrader's Holocaust-themed drama Adam Resurrected (2007) and Pete Travis' assassination-themed political thriller Vantage Point (2008, as a European paramedic with possible ties to clandestine groups).",
